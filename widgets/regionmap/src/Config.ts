/**
 * Validates and resolves the Contact Us widget configuration.

 * Both the widget contract and the runtime configuration are treated
 * as untrusted input. Once validated, the configuration is normalized,
 * resolved and frozen before being exposed to the React application.
 *
 * This function represents the trust boundary between the ReactEdge
 * runtime and the widget implementation.
 *
 * The resolved configuration includes the Cloudflare integration
 * required to render the captcha.
 *
 * @param contract - Widget contract supplied by the host platform.
 * @param runtime - Runtime services supplied by the orchestrator.
 * @param activity - Activity logger for bootstrap events.
 * @returns An immutable Contact Us configuration.
 * @throws When either configuration is invalid.
